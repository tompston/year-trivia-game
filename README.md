### Year trivia game

> Built using Laravel, Vue 3, Typescript and Tailwind

Laravel serves as a REST API that has as single endpoint. That endpoint returns a response which is fetched from the frontend. 
Most of the game logic is done on the client side, backend just returns the used data.

## Notes

Haven't spent a lot of time with PHP/Laravel (less than 20h total), so there are most probably a lot of things that can be improved.
